## Benedetta Arinci

I am an ordinary woman with an extraordinary passion for people. Always eager to learn and intrigued by finding the best solution to problems.
Since I moved to London, 4 years ago, I have been working as a recruiter. I built my career from scratch, starting from zero experience and a basic level of English. I am so proud of it that I wanted to do it again.
Why tech? In any other job, sooner or later, you'll stop learning. In tech you'll always be able to keep on growing as much as you wish.
From what I have experienced so far, when I am coding I always feel outside my comfort zone. The more I learn, the more I feel like I need to learn more. Finding a solution to a problem pushes me to look for new and more challenging ones to solve. This is really an exciting feeling.
I was able to get into Makers, one of the best software development bootcamps in Europe, accepting only 10% of applicants. I am keen to learn as much as possible during the next 12 weeks and I am truly motivated to go through this never-ending learning process applying my knowledge and skills to many real-life projects.
